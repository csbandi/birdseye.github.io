ebird is a citizen science initiative of Cornell lab of ornithilogy. It enables bird watchers and nature lovers log sightings of birds across many parts of the world into a central repository using website or mobile apps.Users can log birds sighted at a location, add media, share checklists and contribute to science whilst having fun. Volunteers across the globe help in monitoring data quality of ebird.

While ebird provides good set of visualisation tools to aid users understand trend, they also provide data dump to enthusiasts, students or general public to analyse and disseminate information.(with a formal request)

In this project, I tried to analyze India specific data from ebird and observe trends. What started off as a data visualisation project with graphs extended to maps , thanks to enthusiastic friends at mapbox.
