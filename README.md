Data visualization of ebird india data
ebird is a citizen science initiative of Cornell lab of ornithilogy. It enables bird watchers and nature lovers across the world log data into a central repository. 
Users can log sightings of birds at a location, add media, share checklists and contribute to science whilst having fun. Volunteers across the globe help in monitoring data quality of ebird.
While ebird provides good set of visualisation tools to aid users understand trend, they also provide open data to enthusiasts across to analyse and disseminate information.

In this project, I tried to analyze India specific data from ebird and observer trends. What started off as a data visualisation project with graphs extended to maps , thanks to enthusiastic friends at mapbox.
